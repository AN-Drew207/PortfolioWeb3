Our smart contracts are divided in 2 main parts: Lending Pool wich holds and moves the assets and the LoanManager that stores and manages the loans, both contracts are upgradeable. One dao can own one or many of these contracts pairs for each token they want to lend. They must use the factory contract to create a pair. We use an ML model that queries data from several subgraphs and other sources to create a probability of how likely is a user to pay a loan. The ML model isnt finished, though. We use a chainlink oracle in the mumbai testnetwork to use this data in future implementations, once the model is well trained with real world data."}]}},{"name":"Share Eth","link":"hackathons/share_eth","liveDemo":"https://shareeth.vercel.app/","hackathonPage":"https://ethglobal.com/showcase/shareeth-4yymo","image":"/img/share_eth.png","codeDescription":{"paragraphs":[{"text":"Introducing ShareEth, a hackathon project turned social media app that empowers content creators by enabling them to monetize their work through various income streams.
